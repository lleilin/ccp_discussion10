            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width="400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different
                beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as
                he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to
                admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his
                energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
                ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <h2>Pluto Dog</h2>
            <img src="images/pluto.jpg" width="400" alt="White dog looking up.">
            <p>Pluto is a five year old rescue dog of an unknown breed. He was found wandering alone and taken to the
                Valley Humane Society where he found his new family. From a young age, Pluto always had a special
                personality, he was known for being very very lazy! He spends most of his time staring out the window to
                keep watch of his house. Don’t let the laziness fool you because Pluto defends his family from the
                mailman and squirrels every single day.</p>
            <P>Aside from his job as defender of the house, Pluto likes to have fun. Pluto’s favorite part of the day is
                his daily walk. Sometimes he even gets to go to the park and meet his neighbors. He also loves his toy
                duck, and only his toy duck. As a dog, it's in his nature to hunt and so he makes sure to get some
                practice with his toy duck.
            </P>

            <h2>Juno</h2>
            <img src="images/classic_juno.JPG" width="400" alt="Black and brown dog asleep on his side.">
            <p>No one knows exactly what breed Juno is, but that makes him all the more special. He was adopted before
                he was one year old; despite this and his German shepherd-esque looks, he stayed close to the same size,
                hovering around 50 lbs into adulthood. At the weathered age of ten years old, Juno is dealing with hip
                problems, but manages to stay in good spirits.</p>
            <P>One of Juno’s favorite pastimes is finding the dirtiest puddle within a one-mile radius and making sure
                every inch of him makes contact with said puddle. If rolling around in dirt was an Olympic sport, Juno
                would have been the one that facilitated its inclusion into the Olympics.
